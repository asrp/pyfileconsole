# pyfileconsole - a file based client-server Python console

Needs Python 3 and has no dependencies.

Run

    python3 pyfileconsole.py

in one terminal and

    python3 client.py

in another one. Then type in the client. For example,

    x = 3
    eval x + 1

## Command-line parameters

The files are too short for command-line parameters. If you want to change something (even the names of the two files used), just edit the scripts. This includes adding command-line paramters for your own usecase.
